		             ,"\n2. if Voltage total is 56 V in a parallel circuit, what is V2 and V3 \na) 34 V\nb)56 V\nc)300 V" 
		             ,"\n3. if the acceleration of an object is 34 m/s and a mass of 1400 KG, what is the force? \na) 50,000 N\nb) 47,600 N\nc) 90,000 N "
		             ,"\n4. if Fnet is 3000 N and mass is 900 KG, what is the acceleration of the object \na) 12 m/s\nb) 3.33 km/h\nc) 70 m/s" 
		             ,"\n5. what is the speed of the car when it has traveled 90 m in 1.6 s ? \na)34 m/s\nb) 70 m/s\nc) 56.25 m/s"
		             ,"\n6. if a car from rest acceleratates from rest to 10 m/s^2 in 4.0 s, what is the displacment? \na)340 m\nb) 80 m\nc) 90 m" 
		             ,"\n7. if the speed of the object is 20 m/s and the speed of sound is 330 m/s \nwith a frequency of 1000 hz, what is the frequency the oberver is getting? \na) 560 hz\nb) 1024 hz\nc) 900 hz"
		             ,"\n8. how many nodes are there in 1 overtone? \na) 2 nodes\nb) 3 nodes\nc) 1 nodes"
		             ,"\n9. When outside tepmretures appear likely to drop just below freezing point of water\nFruit farmers protect their crop by continuously spraying the plants with water. Why do they do this? \na) Since they are continuously spraying, the water won't freez and it will keep the plants watered\nb) when water freezes, it releases latent heat of fusion which keeps the plant warmer\nc) Water is just water"
		             ,"\n10. when is friction helpful and not helpful in real world situations \na) Friction can be helpful when walking, it can act as an grip to walk properly and it can be non-helpful when pushing an object because friction can act opposite to you\nb) friction is just helpful and non-helpfull all the time\nc) friction is just mean to us and never helpful "};
